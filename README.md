# Anchor Application

This is a base application built on top of Slim Framework 3.

I have worked in a number of PHP Frameworks such as Zend Framework, CodeIgniter, CakePHP, and so forth,
but Slim Framework takes a minimalist approach. It does not have an MVC style layout as some of the
other Frameworks, so you have to take control of that yourself. I've set this as a simple app to do
that, and also implement handling database management using the RedbeanPHP ORM.
